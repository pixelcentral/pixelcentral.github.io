Sign in and click on \"**Edit Profile**\". Under \"**Use version**\" choose \"**1.7.10**\". Now start the game once. After you find yourself in the main menu close out.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/pixelcentral/pixelcentral.github.io/blob/master/step1.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Downloading and installing Forge mod loader\r\nForge is needed to manage and load mods. Download Forge [**here**](http://adfoc.us/serve/sitelinks/?id=271228&url=http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.7.10-10.13.4.1614-1.7.10/forge-1.7.10-10.13.4.1614-1.7.10-installer.jar) and simply run the application. Choose \"**Install client**\". \r\n\r\n## Step 3: Downloading and installing mods\r\nAccess the dropbox folder and click on the button in the upper right corner to download the mods as a zip-file.\r\n[**Theircraft modpack files**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y2ykcjmllpfi7kj/AACE4gW1ucDmuEwKIyqYGLKra?dl=0)\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/pixelcentral/pixelcentral.github.io/blob/master/step2.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\nNavigate to your Minecraft installation which should be located under **C:\\Users\\\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\\\.minecraft\\**\r\nCreate a new folder named \"**mods**\" and copy and paste the contents of the zip-folder in there.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/pixelcentral/pixelcentral.github.io/blob/master/step3.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##Step 4: Starting for the first time and adjustements\r\n* Launch Minecraft and under \"**Edit Profile**\" make sure to use the version named \"**release 1.7.10-Forge10.13.4.1614-1.7.19**\"\r\n* Under \"**JVM arguments**\" copy and paste the following: \"-Xmx4G -Xms4G\" you can change the number higher values too depending on how much RAM you have (between 4 and 8 is the sweet spot)\r\n* Hit \"**Play**\" to launch the game. This process may take up a **few minutes** since it actually loads over 100 mods.\r\n* Ignore all update-related messages\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/pixelcentral/pixelcentral.github.io/blob/master/stepf4.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Step 5: Accessing the server\r\nIf you are whitelisted simply click on \"Multiplayer\" and under \"Add server\" type in \"**pixelhub.nitrado.net**\". Now all you have to do is save it and hit connect.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/pixelcentral/pixelcentral.github.io/blob/master/step5.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\nCongratulations !\r\n\r\n",
